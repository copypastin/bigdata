*"What is the avergae time user(s) are online?"*

The purpose of this project is to determine the average time a user/users are online. In order to collect this data, we used players from a Minecraft server as a sample. The data we needed to exact from these subjects are the amount of times they are online, and what time are they online. Our data is organized based with time being the independent variable (x) and the amount of times the user is pinged (in 5-10 second intervals) being our dependent variable (y). We can roughly see a bimodial distributions with peaks in the user count at 2:00-3:00 and 16:00 UTC respectively. I believe that our data is __NOT__ the most accurate as the data is gathered from roughly 4-7 days worth of data. Factors such as weekends, school breaks, and in-game factors may impact the users acitivity.

The average time the player is online is roughly between 0:00 - 6:00 and 14:00 - 24:00 UTC.
