# Big Data Bootcamp Project

*"What is the avergae time user(s) are online?"*

The purpose of this project is to determine the average time a user/users are online. In order to collect this data, we used players from a Minecraft server as a sample. The data we needed to exract from these users are the amount of times they are online and what time are they online. Our data is organized based with time being the independent variable (x) and the amount of times the user is pinged (in 5-10 second intervals) being our dependent variable (y). We can roughly see a bimodial distributions with peaks in the user count at 2:00-3:00 and 16:00 UTC respectively. I believe that our data is __NOT__ the most accurate as the data is gathered from roughly 4-7 days worth of data. Factors such as weekends, school breaks, and in-game factors may impact the users acitivity.

The average time the player is online is roughly between 0:00 - 6:00 and 14:00 - 24:00 UTC.

### Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the Minecraft server for allowing us to collect data from their server.

## Criteria
● **Question:** What do we want to know? What is trying to be solved?

● **Data Collection:** What data do we have and what data do we need?

● **Data Cleaning:** How can we make our data more clear?

● **Exploratory Data Analysis:** How is our data organized? What biases, patterns,
trends, and relationships are in our data? Is our data effective for analysis?

● **Inference and Prediction:** What does our data show or say? Does this answer
our question? How accurate are our predictions? (Optional for this project)

● **Conclusion:** What are our findings from the data? What is the answer to our
question or the decision we make?
